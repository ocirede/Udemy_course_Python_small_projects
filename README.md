## **Python Small Projects**  

### **Projects Overview**  

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects, each designed to help me practice and learn different aspects of Python programming. The projects include a mix of object-oriented programming (OOP), game development, and graphical applications using libraries like Turtle, Tkinter, or Pandas.  

### **1. Birthday Automated Mail**  
- **Description**: This project automates the process of sending personalized birthday invitation emails. It reads a starting template letter from a file and a list of names from another file, replacing the placeholder `[name]` with the actual recipient's name. The personalized emails are then saved to individual files for each recipient.  
- **Skills Learned**: File reading and writing, string manipulation, automating repetitive tasks, and basic email generation.  

### **2. Coffee Machine OOP**  
- **Description**: A simple coffee machine built using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. This project simulates a coffee machine that can make various types of coffee, handle user input, and track resources like water, coffee beans, and milk. It calculates the money received and gives change if necessary.  
- **Skills Learned**: OOP, class and object management, input handling.  

### **3. NATO Alphabet Converter**  
- **Description**: Translates user-input words into their NATO phonetic alphabet equivalents (e.g., "A" â†’ "Alpha"). Uses dictionary mapping and input validation.  
- **Skills Learned**: Dictionary usage, string manipulation, error handling.  

### **4. Paint Hacking (Using Turtle)**  
- **Description**: Creates random dot patterns using Python's Turtle graphics library.  
- **Skills Learned**: Turtle graphics, randomization.  

### **5. Pomodoro Timer**  
- **Description**: Implements the Pomodoro Technique with work/break intervals and session tracking using Tkinter.  
- **Skills Learned**: Tkinter GUI, time management, UI updates.  

### **6. Pong Arcade Game**  
- **Description**: Classic Pong game implementation using Turtle.  
- **Skills Learned**: Game development, collision detection.  

### **7. Quiz Game**  
- **Description**: Text-based multiple-choice quiz with scoring system.  
- **Skills Learned**: User input handling, conditionals.  

### **8. Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**  
- **Description**: CLI implementation of the classic game against computer AI.  
- **Skills Learned**: Randomization, game logic.  

### **9. Snake Game**  
- **Description**: Classic Snake game using Turtle graphics.  
- **Skills Learned**: Game loops, collision detection.  

### **10. Turtle Crossing Road Game**  
- **Description**: Turtle must cross a road with moving cars (Turtle graphics).  
- **Skills Learned**: Event handling, collision detection.  

### **11. US States Game**  
- **Description**: Geography quiz that plots guessed US states on a Turtle graphics map.  
- **Skills Learned**: Pandas data handling, Turtle graphics.  

### **12. Flash Card Game (German-English Translation)**  
- **Description**: Tkinter-based flashcard app for language learning with:  
  - German-English word pairs  
  - Flip animation with delayed translation  
  - Progress tracking (known/unknown words)  
  - Data persistence (CSV or JSON)  
- **Skills Learned**: Tkinter GUI, event binding, file I/O, dictionary manipulation  

### **13. Password Manager Project**  
- **Description**: Tkinter GUI for generating/storing passwords with clipboard support.  
- **Skills Learned**: Tkinter widgets, encryption basics, clipboard integration.
